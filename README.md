# CSVAE-AttDNN-Selector
Interpretable AI for Multiphase Flow: Coupling CS-VAE for augmentation with Att-DNN for precise thermodynamic behavior identification for multiphase flow through chokes.

**Official Implementation of the Paper:**
*"Interpretable Intelligent Selector for Multiphase Flow Modeling through Chokes: A Hybrid Framework using Novel Class-Stratified Variational Autoencoder and Physics-Aware Learning"*

## Overview
This repository hosts the source code for a novel hybrid framework integrating:
1.  **CS-VAE (Class-Stratified Variational Autoencoder):**A generative 			framework for data augmentation that effectively handles class 			imbalance while preserving complex data distributions.
2.  **Att-DNN (Attention-based Deep Neural Network):** For interpretable 			feature selection and classification.

## Code Availability Status
**Under Refactoring:** The codebase is currently being organized into a modular, object-oriented structure to ensure reproducibility.
**Public Release:** The full source code will be released publicly upon the acceptance of the manuscript.

## Contact
**For Reviewers:** If necessary for the review process, additional materials or early access can be requested through the **Journal Editor**.
